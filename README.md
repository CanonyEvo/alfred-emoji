# Alfred-Emoji ðŸ¤”

Python script to compose emoji snippet set based on [emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data).

## Usage

```sh
python3 main.py
```

This will generate a `alfred-emoji.alfredsnippets` file, using data from [https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data). Open the file Finder, and you can get your self the latest set of emoji snippets.

## Why

The original [alfred emoji snippet pack](http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/) doesn't seem to have a method to update with the ever increasing number of emojis. With this script you can always get the latest snippets of emojis.
